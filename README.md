# 🦟 Vector-Borne Disease Spread Prediction

This project uses data science and machine learning to predict the spread of **Malaria and Dengue** based on state-wise health data from the HMIS dataset (2019–20).

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Government health data (uploaded under `dataset/`)
- Focus: Malaria and Dengue case reports across Indian states

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Regressor

## 📊 Results
- ML model predicts March month case counts using earlier month data
- Metrics used: R² Score, RMSE

## 💡 Future Scope
- Integrate real-time weather/environmental data
- Deploy as public health dashboard
